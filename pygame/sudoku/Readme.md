# Sudoku 
It is a game I built while learning Pygame lib of py

It fetches the number on the board from an **API** and is then placed on the board 

It chcks the position of the mouse where it is being clicked at and then it places a white space(when you press '0' for clearing a certain cell) or any number on that cell
